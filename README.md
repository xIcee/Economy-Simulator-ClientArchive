This is the archive of my cached contents from my time on Economy Simulator ([economy-simulator.com](https://economy-simulator.com/)) It used to be a Roblox 2014-16 revival which ran entirely within the web browser. Included in this, is the archived version of the web client in WASM format (WebPlayer.wasm)

The owner of economy simulator, Floatzel had discontinued it in 2023, however he made the source for the servers public for others to use. The client was not as fortunate, but the compiled webassembly is still floating around.
If you're brave enough, you can try decompiling the client and get it running on your own servers, but I'm definitely not capable of this.
